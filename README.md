# Research-Scripts
The various data processing scripts for research.

## Preference
I prefer using python 3 and Gnuplot to format the data and generate figures automatically.

## DLS
I use a Malvern NanoSizer DLS as well as a Brookhaven one.

## Fluorescence
I measure fluorescence emission spectra with a special spectrometer. The wavelength is mainly in the NIR-II range.

## Sharing
I always double check to ensure the scripts online contain no confidential information, so anyone, if interested, is encouraged to download and use them in non-profit research-related scenarios. Since they are very simple, straightforward codes, I do not expect anyone with the intention to use them beyond the GPL license. But if by any chance you do have such a concern, please contact me to obtain a written permission.
