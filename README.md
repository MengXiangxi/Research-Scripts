# Research-Scripts

The various data processing scripts for research.

## Preference

- I prefer using python 3 and Gnuplot to format the data and generate figures automatically.
- I am a Windows 10 user and I use ImageMagick as an image-processing command line tool.
- I use the latest version of MATLAB if possible.

## ColorMask

To generate overlayed color layers on NIR-II camera images. MATLAB + Photoshop.

## Dicom

Some code to process the DICOM files.

## DLS

I use a Malvern NanoSizer DLS as well as a Brookhaven one.

## Fluorescence

I measure fluorescence emission spectra with a special spectrometer. The wavelength is mainly in the NIR-II range.

## Miscellaneous

Simple post-processing tools.

- `collage.bat` To make combined figure panel. Uses ImageMagick.
- `makegif.bat` To make a .gif animation. Uses ImageMagick.
- `fluo_get_ctime.py` To record the creation time of files in a folder.

## Sharing

I always double check to ensure the scripts online contain no confidential information, so anyone, if interested, is encouraged to download and use them in non-profit research-related scenarios. Since they are very simple, straightforward codes, I do not expect anyone with the intention to use them beyond the GPL license. But if by any chance you do have such a concern, please contact me to obtain a written permission.
